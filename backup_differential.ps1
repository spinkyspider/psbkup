 Purpose:       Rotating differential backup using 7-Zip for compression.
 Requirements:  - forfiles.exe from Microsoft
                - 7-Zip

 Version:       0.2.0 + Rebase to PowerShell
 Notes:         My intention for this script was to keep the logic controlling schedules, backup type, etc out of the script and
                let an invoking program handle it (e.g. Task Scheduler). You simply run this script with a flag to perform an action.
                If you want to schedule monthly backups, purge old files, etc, just set up task scheduler jobs for those tasks, 
                where each job calls the script with a different flag.
 Usage:         Run this script without any flags for a list of possible actions. Run it with a flag to perform that action.
                Flags:
                 -f   create full backup
                 -d   create differential backup (full backup must already exist)
                 -r   restore from a backup (extracts to your staging area)
                 -a   archive (close out/rotate) the current backup set. This:
                      1. moves all .7z files in the $destination into a folder named with the current date
                      2. deletes all .7z files from the staging area
                 -p   purge (delete) old backup sets from staging and destination. If you specify a number 
                      of days after the command it will run automatically without any confirmation. Be careful with this!
                 -c   config dump. Show job options (show what the variables are set to)
 Important:     If you want to set this script up in Windows Task Scheduler, be aware that Task Scheduler
                can't use mapped network drives (X:\, Z:\, etc) when it is set to "Run even if user isn't logged on."
                The task will simply fail to do anything (because Scheduler can't see the drives). To work around this use
                UNC paths instead (\\server\backup_folder etc) for your source, destination, and staging areas.
